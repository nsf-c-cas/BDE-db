# BDE-db: A collection of 290,664 Homolytic Bond Dissociation Enthalpies for Small Organic Molecules

A database of 290,664 bond dissociation energies for small molecules (10 or fewer heavy atoms) consisting of C, H, O, or N atoms. Enthalpy calculations were carried out using the M06-2X/def2-TZVP functional / basis set using Gaussian 16. Reported BDEs are in kcal/mol.
